# UART_Transceiver
This project utilizes Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) to design and implement a UART transceiver on an FPGA. The design showcases bidirectional communication between two devices. The FPGA board interfaces with seven-segment displays to visualize data, demonstrating the functionality of the UART protocol in a hardware environment.
